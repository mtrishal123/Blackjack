# Blackjack Game

The deck is unlimited in size. The dealer is the computer. For now, only you can play against the computer 

In the future, I will work on the following features:

-I will add other players
-reduce the deck size to 52
-add bets and calculate winnings of players playing so that it feels like a real game of black jack.
